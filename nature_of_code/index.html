                    <h2>Inspiration from Amrum</h2>
<p>As part of our excursion to Amrum, we were asked to look for structures or processes in nature that we could translate into code.</p>
<p>I decided to focus on the structure of these plants on the salt marsh.</p>
<p>What caught my attention was the clustering of the plants. They grow very densely on the meadow and seem to be limited by the water.</p>
<p>I wanted to capture this phenomenon in my code using particles and a barrier. How is a moving mass confined, and what structures emerge as a result?</p>

                  <h2>Hyperbolic Movement Patterns</h2>
                      <p>The particles move along curved paths. The distinctive "opening" or "curve" that emerges strongly resembles the typical shape of a hyperbola (two mirror-like branches bending away from a common center).</p>
                      <p>In a physical particle system with a barrier, scattering often produces trajectory patterns that can be mathematically described using hyperbolas or similar curves. Likewise in nature (e.g., in light refraction, gravitation, etc.), hyperbola-like patterns appear when a force acts on many individual objects.</p>
                      <p>A moving mass (particles) encounters a barrier and is influenced by an underlying mathematical structure (a hyperbola). In my code, I use this curve logic to generate movements that feel organic while still being mathematically grounded.</p>
